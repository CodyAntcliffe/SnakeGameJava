SnakeGameJava
=============

Classic snake game made in Java.

Pilot the snake and eat the apples as they appear, but avoid walls and your own tail!


This is my first game ever, and stems from my desire to experiment with collision detection.  
It's actually pretty fun, and it even outputs your score in the gameover screen, so you can try to beat your best score.



TO DO LIST:
- Implement DoubleBuffering in order to prevent the annoying screen flicker issue.
- Implement a HIGHSCORE functionality that writes the highest score to a text file.  
- Put a score counter in the top left of the game screen.
- Enable to game window to be resized.
