SnakeGameJava
=============
NOTE:  This was one of the first things I ever wrote in Java, and now looking back I see how terribly coded it is. I'm going to keep the repo live so I can laugh at it in the future.


Classic snake game made in Java.

Pilot the snake and eat the apples as they appear, but avoid walls and your own tail!

This is my first game ever, and stems from my desire to experiment with collision detection.  
It's actually pretty fun, and it even outputs your score in the gameover screen, so you can try to beat your best score.
